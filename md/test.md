# post title (distinct from post "name", filename)

ok yeah here's some intro text. This will typically *will display* in the preview on snips home, but if there are headers, anything below the first header **will not**. Here's a [link](https://google.com/), html relative links will work as normal too.

Here's a second paragraph. Isn't that picture above nice?

[//]: # (break)

## Section heading

The above section should cover 90% of posts, but here's some of the more advanced stuff. Idk how much of this I'll customize.

> Blockquotes are fun, but I want to make sure they line wrap nicely, so I'll need to make this section quite long. asdf alskhdj asfodh osijdf aosdlfh aoisfhaolisdf aosi hfaoshfaoshfwohf oashvolasdh vlasdasdfalksd fasdfas da sdfa sdf as fdasdf

I'm not planning on using lists much, but I'll leave them here as a test.

1. Ordered1
2. Ordered2

Here's a breakline and an unordered list. Gotta consider customizing the bullet list especially, that's a priority.

- Unordered1
- Unordered2

There's some code block support here, but I wouldn't use it in a public post yet.

```go
func getTrue() bool {
    return true
}
```

Footnotes[^1]? sign me up. And ~~strikethroughs~~ could be fun too.

[^1]:ya know, these little guys.
